# Nix Tutorials and Helpful Information

You may want to start with my [Beginner-friendly Flake Tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mhwombat/nix-for-numbskulls/main/tutorial/tutorial.pdf).
It's a work-in-progress, so check back peridically for new material.

I also write short tutorials on aspects of Nix that I feel aren't well-explained elsewhere
(at least at the time of writing).

- [Nix shell recipes](shell-recipes/shell-recipes.md)
- [Nix flake recipes](flake-recipes.md)
- [Investigating Nix packages in the REPL](nixpkgs-repl.md)
- [Super-Simple Haskell Development with Nix](Haskell/ss-haskell-dev.md)
- [Re-use a NixOS Derivation outside of Nix](reuse-nixos-derivation.md)
- [Quickstart Guide to Flakes](flakes.md)
- [The Nix Functions Zoo](field-guide.md)
